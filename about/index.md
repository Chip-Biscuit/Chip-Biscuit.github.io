# 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Chip** — a tech enthusiast, security tinkerer, nostalgic game patch creator, reverse engineer, programmer, and all-around tech explorer.  
I spend my time breaking things (ethically) to understand them, restoring old Windows titles, writing DLL wrappers, and diving deep into system-level programming. I love learning — the harder and more impossible a problem looks, the more I want to solve it.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Reverse engineering & low-level debugging  
- DirectX (D3D8/9) compatibility wrappers  
- Memory trainers & pointer-chain tools  
- Steganography, cryptography & CTF challenges  
- Cyber security & ethical hacking  
- Building inclusive tech spaces like **ByteMatrix** & **FixEnhancers**  
- Developing tools, software, and hardware that simply get the job done  
- Former fully-qualified electrician with a Diploma in Installing Electrotechnical Systems and Equipment (BSE)  
- Experimenting with Raspberry Pi and Arduino — automation scripts, Pi-holes, and all sorts of fun little projects  
- Exploring game engines (Unreal, Godot), creative programs (Blender, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve), and making content for YouTube or TikTok  
- Modding old games and bringing forgotten code back to life

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Breaking things to understand them.”  
>
> Curiosity is the core of progress — every bug, crash, and hex dump is an opportunity to learn something new.  
>
> Nothing is impossible… it’s more a question of how long it will take to break it.

<p style="font-size:0.9em; color:#9aa4b2; margin-top:0.5em;">
I’m passionate about creating tech spaces that value different ways of thinking — <em>neurodivergent minds often see systems and patterns others miss.</em>

## 🕹️ Fun Fact

I still love debugging early-2000s PC games just to bring them back to life — there’s something magical about watching old code run perfectly on modern hardware.
