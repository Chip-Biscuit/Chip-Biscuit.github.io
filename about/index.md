# 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Chip** — a Tech enthusiast, security tinkerer, nostalgic game patch creator, Reverse Engineer, Programmer and all-around tech explorer.  
I spend my time breaking things (ethically) to understand them, restoring old Windows titles, writing DLL wrappers, and diving deep into system-level programming. i love learning. 
The harder and more impossible the problem looks... the more i want to solve it.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Reverse engineering & low-level debugging  
- DirectX (D3D8/9) compatibility wrappers  
- Memory trainers & pointer-chain tools  
- Steganography, cryptography & CTF challenges  
- Cyber security and ethical hacking  
- Building inclusive tech spaces like **ByteMatrix** & **FixEnhancers**  
- Developing tools, software, and hardware that simply get the job done
- Former fully qualfied electrician with Diploma Installing Electrotechnical Systems and Equipment (BSE).
- play around with rasbery pi and arduinos make automation scripts or pi holes all sorts of fun little projects.
- play around in game engines, unreal, godot, programs such as blender or photoshop, davinci resolve, make content for youtube or tiktok, make game mods, the world is endless.
- A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Breaking things to understand them.”  
>
> Curiosity is the core of progress — every bug, crash, and hex dump is an opportunity to learn something new.
>
> Nothing is impossible.. its more a question of how long will it take to brek it..

<p style="font-size:0.9em; color:#9aa4b2; margin-top:0.5em;">
I’m passionate about creating tech spaces that value different ways of thinking — <em>neurodivergent minds often see systems and patterns others miss.</em>

## 🕹️ Fun Fact

I still love debugging early-2000s PC games just to bring them back to life — there’s something magical about watching old code run perfectly on modern hardware.
