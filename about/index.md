# 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Chip** — a tech enthusiast, security tinkerer, nostalgic game-patch creator, reverse engineer, programmer, and all-around tech explorer.  
I spend my time breaking things (ethically) to understand them, restoring old Windows titles, writing DLL wrappers, and diving deep into system-level programming.  
I love learning — the harder and more impossible a problem looks, the more I want to solve it.

## ⚡ Core Focus
*Reverse Engineering · Offensive & Defensive Security · Systems Programming · Hardware & Software Tooling*

> *Exploring systems from silicon to software — building tools, breaking barriers, and defending what matters.*

## 🧠 What I Do

- Reverse engineering & low-level debugging  
- DirectX (D3D8/9) compatibility wrappers — I write game-specific patches on top of existing D3D wrappers, and I’ve also implemented my own DInput8 and other wrapper DLLs.  
- Memory trainers & pointer-chain tools  
- Steganography, cryptography & CTF challenges — I build CTFs and a few custom stego tools of my own  
- Cyber security, security forensics & ethical hacking — including crash diagnostics and deep debugging work to uncover why certain games or programs fail to run correctly  
- Building inclusive tech spaces like **ByteMatrix** & **FixEnhancers**  
- Developing tools, software, and hardware that simply get the job done  
- Former fully qualified electrician with a Diploma in Installing Electrotechnical Systems and Equipment (BSE), who specialised in advanced fault diagnosis, complex control wiring, data cabling, and certification — that hands-on analytical work still shapes how I approach code and systems today  
- Experimenting with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and automation projects — Pi-holes, IoT, and other fun setups  
- Exploring Unreal, Godot, Blender, Photoshop, and DaVinci Resolve — making mods and creative content for YouTube or TikTok

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Breaking things to understand them.”  
>
> Curiosity is the core of progress — every bug, crash, and hex dump is an opportunity to learn something new.  
>
> Nothing is impossible… it’s more a question of how long it will take to break it.

<p style="font-size:0.9em; color:#9aa4b2; margin-top:0.5em;">
I’m passionate about creating tech spaces that value different ways of thinking — <em>neurodivergent minds often see systems and patterns others miss.</em>

## 🧭 Values
- Curiosity drives mastery  
- Ethics above shortcuts  
- Clarity over complexity  
- Learn, teach, and give back to the community

## 🕹️ Fun Fact
I still love debugging early-2000s PC games just to bring them back to life — there’s something magical about watching old code run perfectly on modern hardware.
