# 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Chip Biscuit** — a reverse-engineering enthusiast, security tinkerer, nostalgic game patch creator, and all-around tech explorer.  
I spend my time breaking things (ethically) to understand them, restoring old Windows titles, writing Direct3D wrappers, and diving deep into system-level programming.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- Reverse engineering & low-level debugging  
- DirectX (D3D8/9) compatibility wrappers  
- Memory trainers & pointer-chain tools  
- Steganography, cryptography & CTF challenges  
- Cyber security and ethical hacking  
- Building inclusive tech spaces like **ByteMatrix** & **FixEnhancers**  
- Developing tools, software, and hardware that simply get the job done

## 💡 Philosophy

> “Breaking things to understand them.”  
>
> Curiosity is the core of progress — every bug, crash, and hex dump is an opportunity to learn something new.

## 🕹️ Fun Fact

I still love debugging early-2000s PC games just to bring them back to life — there’s something magical about watching old code run perfectly on modern hardware.
